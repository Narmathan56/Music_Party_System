# Music_Party_System
Music Party System is a Java application developed to practice and demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

The system models a simple music party environment using classes, objects, constructors, methods, and composition. It focuses on clean object design and interaction between components rather than a graphical interface.
