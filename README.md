## Music_Party_System
Music Party System is a Java application designed to model a music management and party-playback environment using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system focuses on clean object design, efficient logic, and structured interaction between components.

# System Design

The project is built around the following core classes:
- Song – represents individual songs with encapsulated attributes

- PlayList – manages collections of songs and their order

- PlayListCollection – handles multiple playlists and playlist operations

- MusicLibrary – stores and manages the overall song catalogue

- MusicParty – coordinates system execution and interactions
